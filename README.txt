MeShClust

We generate the K-mer sequences and covert the sequence into quaternary numbers and generate the histogram data. We calculate the identity scores by comparing different combinations of sequences in the FASTA file and calculate Euclidean distance between them.


Requirements: Python.
Python Libraries: tkinter, BIOPython, Pandas, math, sys.

Compilation:

GUI:-
------

--Run the "Mean_shift.py" program.
--A file browser will open.
--User must enter a FASTA file as the input.
--The program will run and the output is shown in the terminal.

Cmd:-
-----

--Run the "commandLine.py" program.
--The user will get a prompt to enter the Path of the FASTA file.
--The program runs and the output will be shown in the terminal.
